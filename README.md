Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the EDA Course Project. It includes the step-by-step implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis on the provided horse.csv dataset, utilizing data science techniques such as data cleaning, transformation and advanced statistical visualizations.

Libraries Used
pandas & numpy: Data manipulation and numerical calculations.
matplotlib.pyplot & seaborn: Data visualization.
sklearn.preprocessing: Data transformation and label encoding.


Phase 1: Data Preprocessing and Initial EDA
The objective of this phase is to prepare the raw dataset for analysis by systematically handling missing values and outliers, followed by uncovering foundational data patterns through statistical summaries and visualizations.

Tasks Completed in Phase 1
Loading the Dataset: Imported the horse.csv dataset and initialized the Python environment.
Basic Statistical Analysis: Generated statistical summaries (.describe()) and inspected the dataset's structure, data types, and initial records.
Handling Missing Data:
Identified missing values across all columns.
Dropped columns containing more than 70% missing data.
Imputed missing numerical values using the mean.
Imputed missing categorical values using the mode.
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicate rows, standardized all text data to lowercase, and converted character variables into categorical data types.
Data Transformation:
Utilized LabelEncoder to convert the outcome and surgery categories into numerical formats for correlation analysis.
Identified and removed extreme outliers in the pulse column using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Univariate Analysis: Created a histogram with a KDE curve, a percentage bar chart, and a violin plot to analyze individual variables like pulse, outcome, and rectal temperature.
Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between two variables using a scatter plot (rectal temp vs. pulse), a boxplot (pulse across outcomes), and a bar chart (average pulse by surgery status).
Multivariate Analysis: Visualized complex relationships using a correlation heatmap, a FacetGrid (pulse distribution by outcome), and a 4-variable scatter plot colored by outcome and sized by packed cell volume.
